# Resume of the project

We are team **Breeze**. The task is to create a game using HTML5 & CSS3 & JavaScript. The main topic is **"Fire Department"**. We decided to make a website of the Fire Department. An easier way to call for an Emergency is made. The user can see how many units are available.
