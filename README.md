# Features

We are team **Breeze**. The task is to create a game using *HTML5 & CSS3 & JavaScript*. The main topic is **"Fire Department"**. We decided to make a website of the *Fire Department*. An easier way to call for an Emergency is made. The user can see how many units are available and the most recent **news** associated with fires. There is a **map** where the user can see where the *Fire Department* is located. There are **tips** on how to put down a fire in different *occasions*. ðŸ§¯
