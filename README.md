# Features üßØ

Hi! We are team **Breeze**. The task we had to complete for this project was to create a website using *HTML5 & CSS3 & JavaScript*. The topic is **"Fire Department"**. We decided to make the website of the *Fire Department*. Its purpose is to help people take care of fires and an easier way to call an Emergency is provided in the site. The user can see how many *units* are available and the most recent **news** associated with fires. There is also a **map** where the user can see where the *Fire Department* is located. There are **tips** on how to put down a fire in different *occasions*.
